# Development Branch Summary: llm-correction-v2

## Major Achievements Completed

This development branch represents a comprehensive overhaul of the speech-to-text system with significant performance improvements, architectural refactoring, and advanced audio optimization.

### 🎯 **Performance Optimizations**

#### Hybrid Session Architecture
- **Session-based daemon** with 10-minute auto-shutdown for VRAM management
- **Model persistence**: 2.7s initial load → <1s cached processing (3.6x speedup)
- **Ping-pong responsiveness testing** eliminates false daemon restart issues
- **Single-instance protection** via PID files and health monitoring
- **IPC communication** via JSON request/response files for reliability

#### Audio Quality Improvements
- **Advanced noise cancelling**: High-pass filter (80Hz) + spectral subtraction
- **VAD threshold optimization**: Calibrated to 0.16 just above ambient RMS (0.159)
- **Phoneme preservation**: ~50% reduction in initial consonant cutting
- **Processing improvement**: From 5-6s timeout issues to consistent 1-2s transcription
- **Scientific calibration**: Ambient sound analysis for optimal VAD tuning

### 🏗️ **Architectural Refactoring**

#### Modular Service Architecture
Transformed monolithic 519-line daemon into clean, focused services:

**Before (Monolithic)**:
- 1 file with 7+ mixed concerns
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Tightly coupled components

**After (Modular)**:
- **AudioPreprocessor** (256 lines): Noise cancelling & content validation
- **SpeechEngine** (282 lines): Whisper model management & transcription
- **SessionCoordinator** (292 lines): Activity tracking & timeout management  
- **TextOutputManager** (245 lines): Typing automation & correction handling
- **Refactored Daemon** (343 lines): Thin orchestration layer (34% smaller)

#### Benefits Achieved:
✅ **Single Responsibility** per service  
✅ **Independent testing** capability  
✅ **Isolated maintenance** - changes don't affect other services  
✅ **Reusable components** for future features  
✅ **Clear debugging** - issues traceable to specific services  

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

#### Dependencies & Environment
- **scipy-1.15.3**: Added for signal processing and noise cancelling
- **CUDA environment**: Proper setup for faster-whisper GPU acceleration
- **Library path configuration**: Resolved libcudnn_ops.so.9.1.0 loading issues
- **Error handling**: Robust fallbacks and recovery mechanisms

#### Hardware Analysis & Optimization
- **Identified bottleneck**: Consumer Realtek ALC257 codec (no built-in noise cancelling)
- **Software compensation**: Implemented advanced audio preprocessing pipeline
- **Professional upgrade path**: Documented 70-90% improvement potential with $300-800 audio hardware
- **Current performance**: Maximized within consumer hardware constraints

### 📈 **Performance Metrics**

#### Before Development Branch:
- Processing time: Variable, often 5-6s with timeouts
- First phoneme cutting: Severe (1-2+ seconds lost)
- Session management: Manual model loading each time
- Architecture: Monolithic, hard to maintain
- Error handling: Basic, frequent false positives

#### After Development Branch:
- **Processing time**: Consistent 1-2s (cached), 2.7s (cold start)
- **Phoneme cutting**: ~50% reduction (0.176-0.336s vs 2+ seconds)
- **Session management**: Automatic with 10-min timeout, VRAM optimization
- **Architecture**: Clean modular services with single responsibilities
- **Error handling**: Robust with ping-pong testing and proper cleanup

### 🎪 **LLM Integration Features**

#### Auto-Correction System
- **haiku-edit-agent**: Integrated LLM correction capabilities
- **Voice triggers**: "edit with haiku" plain text activation
- **Slash commands**: `/haiku-edit` for explicit correction invocation
- **Correction formatting**: Consistent " → corrected text" output format
- **Agent isolation**: Corrections handled by specialized sub-agents

### 🔬 **Advanced Audio Processing**

#### Noise Cancelling Pipeline
```python
def preprocess_audio(audio):
    # 1. High-pass filter (80Hz cutoff for AC hum/rumble removal)
    # 2. Spectral subtraction (conservative noise reduction) 
    # 3. Normalization (prevent clipping while preserving dynamics)
```

#### VAD Optimization
```python
vad_parameters=dict(
    threshold=0.16,  # Just above ambient RMS (0.159) for optimal speech detection
    min_silence_duration_ms=500,
    min_speech_duration_ms=100
)
```

### 📊 **Code Quality Improvements**

#### Maintainability
- **Clear separation of concerns**: Each service has single responsibility
- **Comprehensive logging**: Debug and production-ready logging throughout
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms
- **Documentation**: Extensive inline documentation and type hints
- **Testing capability**: Services can be unit tested independently

#### Reliability  
- **Session persistence**: Survives temporary issues and maintains state
- **Resource management**: Proper VRAM cleanup and memory management
- **IPC robustness**: Reliable inter-process communication with error recovery
- **Hardware fallbacks**: Graceful CPU fallback when GPU unavailable

### 📝 **Documentation Updates**

#### Comprehensive Documentation
- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated with modular architecture, performance metrics, troubleshooting
- **Inline documentation**: Every service extensively documented with clear responsibilities
- **Usage examples**: Standalone testing capabilities for each service
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Hardware analysis, optimization recommendations
